 ### HR Data Analytics Project Submission Summary – Elevate Labs
I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed and submitted my HR Data Analytics project for Elevate Labs.

This project was focused on analyzing Human Resources data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can support better workforce planning, employee retention, and organizational growth.

## Key highlights of the project:

✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation using Python (Pandas, NumPy)

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in attrition, satisfaction, and salary distribution

✅ Power BI Dashboards to visualize metrics like turnover rate, job satisfaction, department-wise attrition

✅ SQL Queries for extracting, filtering, and joining HR data from multiple sources

✅ Predictive Analysis (optional if used) to identify key factors influencing employee attrition

✅ Business Insights and actionable recommendations to help Elevate Labs optimize employee engagement and HR policies

This project gave me the opportunity to apply my skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI to a real-world HR dataset — transforming raw data into valuable insights and clear visuals for decision-making.

Working on this project deepened my understanding of both data analytics techniques and the HR domain, making it a truly rewarding experience.
